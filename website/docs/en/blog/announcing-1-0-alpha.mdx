# Announcing Rustbolt 1.0 alpha

![](https://assets.rustbolt.dev/rustbolt/rustbolt-banner-v1-0-alpha.png)

Rustbolt 1.0 alpha is now available on npm!

Before releasing Rustbolt 1.0 stable version, we will test for 1~2 months to improve the API stability and reliability of v1.0 and to verify its impact on downstream projects.

Rustbolt 1.0 stable version is expected to be released this August. This is a significant milestone as it means that Rustbolt has implemented the major features and APIs of webpack. This will allow thousands of webpack projects to make a smooth transition while achieving significant improvements in build performance.

## Outputs optimization

Rustbolt 1.0 enables the `optimization.concatenateModules` by default during production builds. This option enables module concatenation optimization, also known as scope hoisting.

```js title="rustbolt.config.mjs"
export default {
  optimization: {
    // Now enabled by default in production
    concatenateModules: mode === 'production',
  },
};
```

The primary purpose of module concatenation is to merge multiple modules into a single function, thereby reducing the overhead associated with parsing and executing JavaScript code in the browser. By merging modules, redundant code such as import and export statements between modules can be reduced, resulting in smaller bundle sizes.

With module concatenation enabled, the output size of Rustbolt can be reduced by about **4% to 10%** (before Gzip).

Currently, Rustbolt has implemented most of the optimization strategies aligned with webpack. In future versions, Rustbolt will explore and make improvements based on webpack to provide deeper optimizations and smaller output sizes.

## Builtin Lightning CSS

Rustbolt 1.0 has built-in integration with [Lightning CSS](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/lightningcss). Lightning CSS is an extremely fast CSS parser, transformer, bundler, and minifier written in Rust.

The new version of Rustbolt has implemented the CSS minimizer plugin based on Lightning CSS, and it is now the default CSS minimizer of Rustbolt. Compared to the previously used SWC CSS minimizer plugin, it applies more optimizations to make the CSS output smaller.

```diff title="rustbolt.config.mjs"
export default {
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [
      // The default CSS minimizer changed:
-     new rustbolt.SwcCssMinimizerRustboltPlugin()
+     new rustbolt.LightningCssMinimizerRustboltPlugin()
    ],
  },
};
```

You can switch back to `SwcCssMinimizerRustboltPlugin` by following configuration.

```js
export default {
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [
      new rustbolt.SwcJsMinimizerRustboltPlugin(),
      new rustbolt.SwcCssMinimizerRustboltPlugin(),
    ],
  },
};
```

For example, Rustbolt already has tree shaking for CSS Modules, but it only removes unused CSS Modules classnames referenced by JS files. With the [unusedSymbols](https://lightningcss.dev/minification.html#unused-symbols) option of Lightning CSS, Rustbolt can now eliminate unused declarations in CSS Modules files, including IDs, keyframes, CSS variables or other CSS identifiers.

We believe that Lightning CSS will become the shared foundation for the next generation build tools, and Rustbolt will support more CSS compilation features based on Lightning CSS.. Thanks to [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett) for creating such an excellent tool.

## Lean core

To ensure the long term stability of Rustbolt v1, we have removed some non-core features that were built into the Rustbolt core. This allows the core to be lean and focused on providing common bundler features.

In v0.x, Rustbolt core has built-in SWC plugins to support Emotion, Styled Components, and Relay. This is because in the early days Rustbolt did not support the use of SWC Wasm plugins and could only integrate them into the core.

Currently, Rustbolt supports the use of SWC plugins via [experimental.plugins](/guide/features/builtin-swc-loader#jscexperimentalplugins) in `builtin:swc-loader`. So we have removed the built-in plugins from the Rustbolt core, including:

- [@swc/plugin-emotion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-emotion)
- [@swc/plugin-relay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-relay)
- [@swc/plugin-styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc/plugin-styled-components)

Take `@swc/plugin-styled-components` as an example. In v1.0, you can use it as follows.

- Installation:

```bash
npm i @swc/plugin-styled-components -D
```

- Configuration:

```diff
export default {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: "builtin:swc-loader",
        options: {
-         rustboltExperiments: {
-           styledComponents: {},
-         },
          jsc: {
+           experimental: {
+             plugins: [["@swc/plugin-styled-components", {}]],
+           },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Bundling CSS

Rustbolt 1.0 aligns with the webpack [experiment.css](/config/experiments#experimentscss) default value, making it easier to migrate from webpack to Rustbolt.

In the webpack ecosystem, there are three common approaches to bundling CSS files:

1. Use [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) and [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) to generate standalone CSS files.
2. Use [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) and [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) to inject CSS through `<style>` tags.
3. Use [experiment.css](/config/experiments#experimentscss), an experimental feature introduced in webpack 5 that provides native CSS support.

In version 0.x, Rustbolt enabled `experiment.css` by default, which would conflict with css-loader. Users had to manually disable `experiment.css` to use css-loader.

Starting with Rustbolt 1.0, the default value of `experiment.css` changes to `false`, in line with webpack, allowing users to use any of the above approaches.

You can add the following configuration to continue using `experiment.css`:

```js title="rustbolt.config.mjs"
export default {
  experiments: {
    css: true,
  },
};
```

## How to upgrade

To install the alpha version of Rustbolt and Rustbolt CLI:

```bash
# npm
npm add -D --save-exact @rustbolt/core@alpha @rustbolt/cli@alpha

# yarn
yarn add -D --save-exact @rustbolt/core@alpha @rustbolt/cli@alpha

# pnpm
pnpm add -D --save-exact @rustbolt/core@alpha @rustbolt/cli@alpha
```

During the Rustbolt alpha testing, new versions will still introduce some breaking changes, which we will highlight in the changelog. Please read the changelog to understand the differences before upgrading.

For Rsbuild users, please wait for the release of Rsbuild 1.0 alpha version (expected in 1-2 weeks).
