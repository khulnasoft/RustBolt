## The name

When used standalone, Rustbolt should always be written as Rustbolt, not rustbolt or RUSTBOLT or RUSTBolt. However, lowercase letters can be used in command lines or package names, such as `@rustbolt/cli`.

## Rustbolt logo

Rustbolt logo is a small crab as fast as lightning, representing fast compilation of Rustbolt.
