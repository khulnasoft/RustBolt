# Use Rsdoctor

[Rsdoctor](https://rsdoctor.dev/) is a build analyzer that can visually display the build process, such as compilation time, code changes before and after compilation, module reference relationships, duplicate modules, etc.

If you need to debug the build outputs or build process, you can use Rsdoctor for troubleshooting.

## ðŸ’¡ What is Rsdoctor?

- Rsdoctor is a one-stop tool for diagnosing and analyzing the build process and build artifacts.
- Rsdoctor is a tool that supports **Rustbolt** or **webpack** build analysis.
- Rsdoctor is an analysis tool that can display the time-consuming and behavioral details of the compilation.
- Rsdoctor is a tool that can analyze the time-consuming and compilation process of the rustbolt builtin:swc-loader.

## ðŸ”¥ Features

- **Compilation Visualization**: Rsdoctor visualizes the compilation behavior and time consumption, making it easy to view build issues.

  - Build artifact support for resource lists and module dependencies, etc.
  - Build-time analysis supports Loader, Plugin, and Resolver building process analysis, including: **Rustbolt's builtin:swc-loader**.
  - Build rules support duplicate package detection and ES Version Check, etc.

- **Support Custom Rules**: In addition to built-in build scan rules, Rsdoctor also supports users adding custom component scan rules based on the build data of Rsdoctor.

### More features

You can see more details of features from this wiki: [Rsdoctor Features](https://rsdoctor.dev/guide/start/features).

### Bundle analysis

You can use Rsdoctor for **[Bundle Analysis](/guide/optimization/analysis#rsdoctors-bundle-analysis)** in Rustbolt.

### Compilation analysis

Rsdoctor is a build analyzer that can visually display the compilation time of each loader and plugin. See [Compilation Analysis](/guide/optimization/profile#rsdoctors-compilation-analysis) for more details.

## Quick start

In an Rustbolt-based project, you can enable Rsdoctor as follows:

1. Install the Rsdoctor plugin:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsdoctor/rustbolt-plugin -D" />

2. Register the `RsdoctorRustboltPlugin` plugin:

:::danger

- Please do not use Rsdoctor in production version.

:::

Initialize the RsdoctorRustboltPlugin plugin in the [plugins](/config/plugins.html#plugins) field of Rustbolt configuration, as shown below:

```ts title="rustbolt.config.mjs"
import { RsdoctorRustboltPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/rustbolt-plugin';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    process.env.RSDOCTOR &&
      new RsdoctorRustboltPlugin({
        // plugin options
      }),
  ],
};
```

3. Add `RSDOCTOR=true` env variable before the CLI command:

```bash
# dev
RSDOCTOR=true rustbolt serve

# build
RSDOCTOR=true rustbolt build
```

After running the above commands, when the build is completed, it will open the build analysis page. For complete features, please refer to [Rsdoctor document](https://rsdoctor.dev/).

4. **[Optional]** Configure Options

You can refer to this document [**options**](https://rsdoctor.dev/config/options/options) for parameter configuration of the RsdoctorRustboltPlugin.
