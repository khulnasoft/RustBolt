# Quick start

Get up to speed quickly with a new Rustbolt based project.

- [Create a new project](#create-a-new-project): Use the CLI to create a brand-new Rustbolt or Rsbuild project.
- [Migrating from existing projects](#migrating-from-existing-projects): Migrate from a webpack-based project to Rustbolt.
- [Ecosystem](#ecosystem): Discover projects within the Rustbolt community ecosystem.

## Setup environment

Rustbolt supports using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Deno](https://deno.com/), or [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the runtime.

### Node.js

For Node.js, please install Node.js >= 16, it is recommended to use the Node.js LTS version.

Check the current Node.js version with the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If you do not have Node.js installed in current environment, or the installed version is too low, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install.

Here is an example of how to install via nvm:

```bash
# Install Node.js LTS
nvm install --lts
# Switch to Node.js LTS
nvm use --lts
```

## Create a new project

### Using Rsbuild

Rsbuild is a high-performance build tool powered by Rustbolt and developed by the Rustbolt team. It provides a set of thoughtfully designed default build configs, offering an out-of-the-box development experience and can fully unleash the performance advantages of Rustbolt.

We recommend using [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) to create new projects, simply run the following command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rsbuild@latest" />

> For more information, refer to [Rsbuild - Quick start](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/start/quick-start).

### Using the Rustbolt CLI

Rustbolt CLI is a tool comparable to webpack CLI, offering the basic `serve` and `build` commands.

Rsbuild supports Node.js >= 16, but Rustbolt CLI requires Node.js version >= 18.12.0.

Run the following command to create an Rustbolt CLI project:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rustbolt@latest" />

Then follow the prompts in your terminal.

### Quick creation

[create-rustbolt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-rustbolt) and [create-rsbuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-rsbuild) provides some CLI flags. By setting these CLI flags, you can skip the interactive selection steps and create the project with one command.

For example, to create a React project in the `my-project` directory with one command:

```bash
# Rustbolt CLI
npx create-rustbolt --dir my-project --template react
# Rsbuild
npx create-rsbuild --dir my-project --template react
# Using abbreviations
npx create-rsbuild -d my-project -t react
```

## Online examples

We provide an online example based on Rsbuild. The example gives an intuitive feel for the build performance of Rustbolt and the development experience of Rsbuild:

- [Rsbuild CodeSandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/rustbolt-contrib/rsbuild-codesandbox-example)

## Manual installation

Start by creating a project directory and generating an npm `package.json':

```bash
mkdir rustbolt-demo
cd rustbolt-demo
npm init -y
```

Then installing [@rustbolt/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rustbolt/core) and [@rustbolt/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rustbolt/cli) as dev dependencies:

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rustbolt/core @rustbolt/cli -D" />

Update your build scripts to use Rustbolt CLI:

```js title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "rustbolt dev",
    "build": "rustbolt build"
  }
}
```

Next, see [Configure Rustbolt](/config/index) to learn about how to configure Rustbolt.

## Migrating from existing projects

If you need to migrate from an existing project to Rustbolt stack, you can refer to the following guides:

- [Migrating from webpack to Rustbolt](/guide/migration/webpack)
- [Migrating from webpack to Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/webpack)
- [Migrating from Create React App to Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/cra)
- [Migrating from Vue CLI to Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/vue-cli)
- [Migrating from Vite to Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/vite)
- [Migrating from Tsup to Rslib](https://lib.rsbuild.dev/guide/migration/tsup)
- [Migrating from Storybook](/guide/migration/storybook)

## Install canary version

When you need to test or verify the features of Rustbolt that are not yet released to the stable version, you may need to use the canary version.

The canary version of Rustbolt has a `-canary` suffix in the package scope. For example, the canary package name of `@rustbolt/core` is `@rustbolt-canary/core`. To use these versions, you can configure the overrides of the package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun).

Here is an example of using pnpm overrides:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "@rustbolt/core": "npm:@rustbolt-canary/core@latest"
    },
    "peerDependencyRules": {
      "allowAny": ["@rustbolt/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Rustbolt community also provides [install-rustbolt](https://github.com/rustbolt-contrib/install-rustbolt) tool to easily install canary version:

```shell
npx install-rustbolt --version latest # Install the latest version
npx install-rustbolt --version canary # Install the canary version
npx install-rustbolt --version 1.0.0-canary-d614005-20250101082730 # Install the specified canary version
```
