# Introduction

Rustbolt enhances its compilation capabilities through a rich ecosystem of plugins. These plugins fall into the following categories:

## Webpack-aligned built-in plugins

To align with webpack's functionality, Rustbolt has replicated most of webpack's built-in plugins. They maintain the same naming and configuration parameters as closely as possible and provide the same features.

See [Webpack-aligned built-in plugins - Overview](/plugins/webpack/index) for more details.

## Rustbolt-only built-in plugins

Combining its own implementation characteristics, Rustbolt offers several unique plugins as alternatives to corresponding plugins from the webpack ecosystem, aiming to deliver more efficient performance.

Including:

- [CircularDependencyRustboltPlugin](/plugins/rustbolt/circular-dependency-rustbolt-plugin)
- [CopyRustboltPlugin](/plugins/rustbolt/copy-rustbolt-plugin)
- [CssExtractRustboltPlugin](/plugins/rustbolt/css-extract-rustbolt-plugin)
- [HtmlRustboltPlugin](/plugins/rustbolt/html-rustbolt-plugin)
- [LightningCssMinimizerRustboltPlugin](/plugins/rustbolt/lightning-css-minimizer-rustbolt-plugin)
- [SwcJsMinimizerRustboltPlugin](/plugins/rustbolt/swc-js-minimizer-rustbolt-plugin)

## Compatible plugins from the webpack ecosystem

Rustbolt strives to maintain compatibility with the webpack plugin ecosystem to leverage the excellent features that have been accumulated and validated by the community. Please refer to the [Plugin Compatibility List](/guide/compatibility/plugin) to access a list of webpack plugins that have passed our compatibility tests.
