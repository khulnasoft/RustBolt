## Credits

Thanks to:

- [The webpack team and community](https://webpack.js.org/) for creating a great bundler and ecosystem from which we draw a lot of inspiration.
- [@sokra](https://github.com/sokra) for the great work on the [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) project.
- [@ScriptedAlchemy](https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy) for creating Module Federation and helping Rustbolt connect with the community.
- The [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) project created by [@kdy1](https://github.com/kdy1), which powers Rustbolt's code parsing, transformation and minification.
- The [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) project created by [@evanw](https://github.com/evanw), which inspired the concurrent architecture of Rustbolt.
- The [NAPI-RS](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) project created by [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn), which powers Rustbolt's node-binding implementation.
- The [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) project created by [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett) which is the pioneer of rust bundler and inspired Rustbolt's incremental rebuild design.
- The [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) project created by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) which inspired Rustbolt's compatibility design of webpack's ecosystem.
- The `rolldown-legacy` project created by old Rolldown team, It's the predecessor of the [rolldown](https://github.com/rolldown) project, which explores the possibility of making a performant bundler in Rust with Rollup-compatible API. It inspires the design principles of Rustbolt.
- The [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) project created by [@jantimon](https://github.com/jantimon), `@rustbolt/html-plugin` is a fork of [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) to avoid some webpack API usage not supported in Rustbolt.
- The [Turbopack](https://github.com/vercel/turbo) project which inspired the AST path logic of Rustbolt.
- The [react-refresh-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin) created by [@pmmmwh](https://github.com/pmmmwh), which inspires implement [react refresh rustbolt plugin](https://github.com/rustbolt-contrib/rustbolt-plugin-react-refresh).
- The [prefresh](https://github.com/preactjs/prefresh) created by [@Jovi De Croock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock), which inspires implement [preact refresh rustbolt plugin](https://github.com/rustbolt-contrib/rustbolt-plugin-preact-refresh).
