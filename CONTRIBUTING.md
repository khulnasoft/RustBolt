## About the dev guide

Before starting your contribution, please take a moment and read the [dev guide](https://rustbolt.dev/contribute/).

The development guide is a set of guidelines and instructions that help contributors understand how to work on Rustbolt.
It covers everything from setting up the development environment to coding style and testing guidelines.

The Rustbolt team believe that creating a development guide for Rustbolt is a great way to build a good relationship with the open source community.
